Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This repository contains a Python-based GUI application for performing customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

Features:

Data Upload: Allows users to select a CSV file containing customer data.
Feature Selection: Enables users to choose the relevant features for clustering (e.g., total_spent, number_of_purchases, age).
K-Means Clustering: Implements K-Means clustering to group customers based on selected features.
Cluster Analysis: Calculates and displays key metrics for each cluster, such as average spending, number of purchases, and customer count.
Interactive Visualization: Presents a dynamic scatter plot that updates in real-time as the number of clusters is changed.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive GUI with clear labels and user guidance.
